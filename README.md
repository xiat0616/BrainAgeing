# Learning to synthesise the ageing brain without longitudinal data 
The proposed method synthesises the ageing version of a given brain with preserving subject identity. The project is the code of our [MICCAI 2019 work](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-32251-9_82.pdf) and [its extension in Medical Image Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841521002152).

## Example results
Here we first show a result image.![image](https://github.com/xiat0616/BrainAgeing/blob/master/example%20results/example_results.png) We generate the synthetically aged images given input image and target ages. Check our [Journal paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841521002152) for more details.

A video is also provided in the [example results](https://github.com/xiat0616/BrainAgeing/tree/master/example%20results) folder.
